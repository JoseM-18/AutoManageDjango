# Frontend README

This is the frontend part of the Django application for managing the inventory and orders of a car dealership. It is built with React and uses Django Template for rendering the HTML templates.

## Getting Started

To run the frontend, you need to have Node.js and npm installed on your system. You can install them from the official website: https://nodejs.org/

Once you have Node.js and npm installed, you can install the dependencies by running the following command in the `frontend` directory:

```
npm install
```

To start the development server, run the following command:

```
npm start
```

This will start the server at http://localhost:3000/ and open the home page in your default browser.

## Project Structure

The `public` directory contains the HTML templates for the application. The `src` directory contains the React components and styles.

The `App.js` file is the root component for the application. It defines the routes and includes the other components.

The `components` directory contains the components for the home page, inventory page, orders page, and error page.

The `styles` directory contains the CSS styles for the components.
